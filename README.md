BeerHub

BeerHub is a place for homebrewers to find and share their favorite homebrew recipes. 

It is my first real web app and I'll be using Ruby on Rails, Twitter Bootstrap, MongoDB (Mongoid), and Heroku.

It's going to be very buggy at this stage, but you can [*see it live here*](http://sharp-sunset-7815.herokuapp.com/). 

Let me know what you think!

Thanks,
Matt
